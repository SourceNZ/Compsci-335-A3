Compsci 335 3rd assignment first commit


This assignment uses an OData REST service - called OData-XML – which accepts OData GET requests to retrieve data from three XML “table” documents: XCategories.xml, XProducts.xml and XSuppliers.xml, in ATOM+XML or JSON formats.
These XML documents are trimmed + slightly modified versions of the similarly named tables – Categories, Products and Suppliers – from the public and well-known NorthwindSQL database sample. 
Written in C# and will be compiled with the command-line complier, CSC, via a given batchfile. 
Service is tested by running IISExpress via another given batch file (on port 8181).
